                                        In flat rate pricing, the product is offered with a set of features at a predetermined price. There are no pricing options or features to choose from. The method is basically based on the “one size fits all” pricing strategy and you charge your customers the same amount monthly/annually regardless of how many users or their usage is.

                                        Tiered pricing model is based on the tiered pricing strategy when it comes to the real world pricing scenario. Both terms are used interchangeably, leading to a potential confusion. <a href="/resources/glossaries/tiered-pricing-model-strategy/" class="cg-link">This post spells the difference between the two.</a> In the tiered pricing model different versions of the product is offered at varied prices. These can be based on features, number of users or usage and is decided by the business based on the product they have to offer. Usually 2 to 5 tiers are created and your customers are allowed to choose from the same based on their needs. Using this pricing model you can upsell to your customers incrementally which can include features as they scale. The pricing tiers should be carefully constructed with an appropriate strategy failing which your customer will end up getting confused.

The usage can be charged based on a variety of factors such as number of Emails being sent, per API, per call, per transaction etc., There are few variants of usage based SaaS models, some are purely usage based and some have a base subscription fee and then will be charged according to usage.

                                            You cannot charge the customer based on their organisation size and you might lose a revenue in the same process. For instance, you might end up charging your enterprise customers less because they use less and a startup will be charged more if they use more. In this case, you might miss out on revenue which will be generated by your enterprise customers.

In Freemium, certain features are offered for free and a paid upgrade is available when they want to access more functionality the product has to offer. In the Freemium model you usually keep your potential customers in the free product incubator and target sales and marketing campaigns exclusively for them so that they can upgrade.

Teams can enroll as many users as possible to buy the product but they will be charged only based on the ones who use them. This means that no money is spent on vacant places.

                                        Why? This ratio helps you arrive at a profitable business model. The ratio between these two parameters should always be greater than 1, so that you don’t lose money on every customer you get. A lower LTV/CAC ratio shows how long it takes for your customer to payback, which could result in a potential loss for your business. Many companies ignore the importance of the ratio and step into the zone of losing money in their business with every new customer.

                                        Expansion MRR is the ratio which tells us about the revenue generated through add-ons, upsells and cross-sells. It is given in terms of percentage. It shows if you can deliver and add more value to your customer such that you can monetize the monetize the value. It is calculated by subtracting total expansion MRR at the beginning of the month from the total expansion at the end of the month, divided by the total MRR at the beginning of the month and multiplying the resultant by 100.

                                        Upgrade MRR is similar to expansion MRR, but it mostly concentrates only on upgrades and is applicable to subscription based businesses. When a customer upgrades from one of the existing plans to a higher plan for the need for more functionality and features, then it is called as the upgrade MRR. It is calculated by subtracting the cost of the higher plan with the cost of the existing plan.
