The situation is critical, and companies are taking actions across the board. The real problem though is that we don’t know how long this will last. If it lasts for a month or two then the actions taken by companies might seem drastic - if it drags on, then they might seem timely.

                                            We cannot dispute the fact that even well-run companies are going bankrupt. Suppliers in the hospitality industry, they had to shut down their entire business overnight. At best they planned to cut out 70-80% of their staff and if they trudged along the bad waters for too long, they simply had to close their business. You can imagine the hot seat their finance director was sitting on.

Their customers kept paying in spite of sales being down. To top it they were announcing new customers in the middle of the crisis. The realization dawned on me: Businesses with a recurring model were able to perform better than their counterparts who’re dependent on the physical element.

                                            The crisis has gotten companies going into cost-cutting modes to curb spending. Businesses working closely with the most affected sectors (example given above) are facing the wrath of this pandemic. Even though many businesses are laying off their workforce, this might not be the most effective option. In many countries, you’ve got a notice period of 1-3 months. So how does that help in the shorter-term? The truth is that it doesn’t. It will only help if the crisis lasts longer or you were planning to do these cuts anyway.

Employee benefits are also in scope, so the Summer party is gone, there is no more teambuilding or bonuses waiting to fill your bank accounts (as the business results take care of that).

                                            It’s too early to say if lay-offs are the right option to save the businesses. But if we’re looking at a V-shaped recovery then laying off people will put you in a very poor situation. This is because once things regain momentum, it’ll be difficult to re-hire fast. You’ll be scaling slowly in comparison to your competitors impacting your future growth. 
                                            A better way forward is to temporarily cut salaries like how many companies doing. Alternatively making use of government-sponsored plans to send people home with pay. In this case you can simply pick up work again once the crisis is over. If the crisis doesn’t pass soon the risk is about how little you’ve done and it might be late to lay-off people.

                                            Considering twice before laying-off your employees is the right way to go! Re-hiring will be troublesome in the future as your brand will be taking the damage. People might be cautious before applying because they would want the companies to be sticking with them through thick and thin.

This value driver tree goes beyond your P&L spending and into your balance sheet and your company risk profile.

                                            A good dashboard with all spend categories in real-time (or at least weekly) is a good first step. Here you’re not looking at accounting numbers but rather purchase orders, credit card activity, etc. anywhere which helps you find out if your spending is coming down or not.

                                            The last thing you can do, especially for more structured initiatives, is to create a value log where you track the impact of each initiative you take. While your general spending dashboard will tell you if the overall direction is right or not the value log will tell you whether specific initiatives are successful or not. If you see one initiative failing, for instance, you might decide to act regardless if the overall numbers are good or not.

                                                The new thing about this landscape is that the baseline has moved and we don’t know how much our baseline has moved. It's always best to be more aggressive up front and assuming how bad things might be in terms of the new world we're in.
                                            </li>

                                                The other side of this situation is that we’re not sure how long we’re going to be at that bottom of the trough. If it seems long enough, ask “How long will this last for?”. That would be the other major assumption going into this model. And then look at which road back to the new normal are you also assuming is going to occur?  Is it going to be fast? Is it going to be slow? Will it be sooner? Will it be later?
                                            </li>

                                                The general takeaway from this would be, anytime you’re talking about a forecast you need to have clarity on the assumptions you're making about each of those.

                                                To be clear about a forecast you need to know the answer to these three questions: how bad is the new baseline, how long will we be there? And what are we assuming about recovery?

                                                In your weak case, strong case and best-case scenarios, you need to have your assumptions branching into them. In addition, you need to make other decisions about how bad will it get, how long will it last and what does recovery look like?

And to the extent, you have a model like that, which is highly dependent on the success of your own customers in terms of their revenue to pay you more.

                                        Cash flow analysis, in simple terms, is the amount of money flowing in and out of your business. It measures the liquidity of your business.

It’s good to plan for the good and bad things and not assume we’re going to have a V-shaped recovery. Practice conservatism and have 1-3 months of runaway. This is impactful if the current situation is going to linger longer.

                                        This could be anywhere from 10-15 days. If you have a lot of enterprise customers, they might be paying on net 90 terms, and you’ll know it’s upwards of 90. If you get paid in 20 days, pre-crisis, depending on the business you’re collecting from, it might be 30, 35 or 40 days moving forward. This is a huge impact-driver from the outlook of working capital. When you’re forecasting ahead say 3-6 months from now, look at day sales outstanding.

                                        While calculating customer acquisition costs, understand your payback period across different channels. If you see a marketing channel where the CAC is greater than the runway then try to minimize it. Focus on places you’ll generate better ROI. Focus on areas where you can drive value and drive cash into areas where efficiency is guaranteed. The goal should be to either maintain your growth and protect you from potential loss from a revenue standpoint.

The next is a W-shaped recovery. In this, you’ll be seeing a dip in your Q2 revenue and will be anticipating a recovery in Q4.

Not just this, you can analyze an array of metrics that’ll show you how well you’re doing right now.

                                        The next part you need to look at is your growth sustainability. Uncertain times like these call for a stable growth curve, which will keep your business afloat. But growth shouldn’t be at the cost of profitability. If you acquire a customer with a higher CAC and low LTV, it means you’re scaling but not profitably. Therefore, you need to look at metrics to keep your growth and profitability balanced to avoid overspending.

The only challenge you’ll be facing with discounts is that you don’t want your customers to get used to that situation given the scope for it. In this case, offering payment terms is better. It is also slightly easier when compared to discounts. But this depends on the dollar value you’re attributing to it.
