It challenges the very assumption that sales productivity is the key to growth. In fact, the added cost of earning every additional dollar is close to zero.

                                    <strong>High revenue per employee (RPE):</strong> SaaS was always built to scale well, but with a self-service approach, you’re able to do more with far fewer people on your team. Fewer support requests, less hand-holding, and automatic upgrades mean higher profit margins per customer.

While product managers, engineers, and founders have a direct influence on the product, oftentimes sales (eg: increasing PQL conversions) or even marketing (for eg: tackling virality or pricing experiments) plays a pivotal role in shaping it.

                                            Word-of-mouth is, undoubtedly, the most powerful marketing medium at your disposal. And the best (and most challenging) part about it - you can’t buy it off a store. You need to earn your word-of-mouth recommendations.

                                           Not for every business, but if your product consistently exceeds customer expectations, and gets them excited with every use, this could be an effective acquisition enabler. If your product makes customers so delirious with joy that they can’t stop talking about it to everyone they meet, it’s high time you designed a strategy to capture that word-of-mouth already.

He shared the tool with a few people, and it just took off from there. People naturally wanted to rave about the app that kept them focused on what matters without getting sucked into the Internet black hole. Within a year, with zero marketing, Fred earned over half a million users, just through word of mouth.

The users on the free plan ended up being responsible for a large portion of our expenses but never had any intention to ever upgrade.

                                                A free trial or a freemium is a promise of value that you’re letting people realize by themselves. Either of the editions should make it incredibly easy for people to use your product and realize value soon. And that ultimately should yield more conversions, a higher number of loyal customers, and higher lifetime value.

                                        Your job does not stop with just acquiring users into the funnel. To prevent your product from turning into a leaky bucket, your app experience should drive users to get “activated” and “retained”.

By designing specific points that capture a prospect’s intent to make a purchase, the business is able to drive sales conversations through the product experience. Voila! <em>Product Qualified Leads</em>.

                                        For a SaaS business that thrives on recurring revenue, retention is equally, if not more, important than acquisition. It doesn’t matter how many active customers your acquisition strategy acquires, if none of them stick around after signing up.

                                        A product-led approach can make your retention strategies more proactive. For instance, a range of product usage insights could throw light on the reasons why someone might leave your product, the signs that a customer is getting ready to leave, and the existing value gaps.

                                            <em><strong>Customer Churn</strong></em> (or Logo Churn) occurs when a customer does not renew, leading to a cancellation. Even with a great product, amazing support, and top-notch training, some customers are just going to leave. And when that happens, a considerable proportion of the energy, time, and money invested in onboarding goes down the drain. Since Customer Churn impacts your growth metrics like Total Active Users it can have a crushing effect on your morale. But it might not be all that bad if you’re losing your lower tier customers to acquire the ones that actually grow your bottomline.

                                            If a product truly adds value for you, you will engage with it more deeply. If it makes you happy, you visit it more frequently and become an active user. In other words, engagement drives stickiness, which drives retention — and that, in turn, drives growth.

This way, customers who are realizing recurring value from your product are not just less likely to churn out; they are more likely to fight to keep your service active in the face of budget cuts, competitor offers, etc.

                                                    A strongly negative net revenue churn means that a company’s revenue would increase even if there were no new sales.

                                                    If net revenue churn is near zero, then churn erases the growth from upsells, so all growth must come from new customers.
