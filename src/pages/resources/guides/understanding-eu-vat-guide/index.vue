If these businesses are from other EU member states with a valid VAT number, you don’t need to add tax. The reverse-charge mechanism takes care of this for you.

The responsibility for tax reverses from your business back to the customer, so that the tax money goes directly from customer to the government.

                                        There could be instances where a business customer does not have a valid VAT number, say when their sale is below the VAT threshold or their VAT validation status is found to be INVALID when VIES database is yet to be updated. In such cases, if you validate the customer as a legitimate business, Chargebee allows you to intervene manually and apply reverse charge - with or without a valid VAT number.
