                            You are a self-serve business model. Probably even a hybrid of a self-serve and a sales-driven model. Your business model is a conscious decision, birthed from the nature of your product, your approach to the sales model, or even your goal of scale.

                            While the self-serve business model by itself is a fuel for acquiring more customers, one of your top problems will continue to be  acquisition and conversion at scale — with minimal human intervention and maximum automation.

                            For your business, a typical acquisition pattern may look like this: Prospect discovers your top of the funnel blog post on Google, an ad, or a mention in a publication. Prospect, then, visits your pricing page. Prospect signs up for a free trial.

                            The acquisition pattern for your business is driven by people (teams), processes, and products. Your sales and marketing teams will actively drive people into the website and the product, and convince them to try out your product or service.

                            But there’s more. It starts from the payments page — automating collection of customer and payment information and creating a record. And it ends with ensuring every last information is collected, your prospect has converted into a customer, you have closed the loop. Until renewal is in the vicinity.

Once inside your product, the user now wants to upgrade to a higher plan all by herself.

                                        Pricing has always been a tricky affair. Price too high, you lose customers. Price too low, you lose value. Finding the sweet spot has been one of the oft discussed topics in the realm of SaaS. And every pricing expert will recommend that you need to keep testing and iterating. Just like we did.

                                        Do you iterate on pricing such that any change to the product reflected in the value and pricing, like Shopify? Or do you revise the pricing understanding the customer segment, like Zendesk? Or do you tailor your pricing according to the core differentiating features, like Statuspage?

                                        Switzerland-based scheduling app, Doodle, is a freemium tool — where users sign up for a forever-free plan, and you need to upgrade to a paid plan to benefit from additional capabilities. 
                                    </p>

                                        “Most of our customers start by using the freemium product. They come to Doodle, create poll (which means they’re trying to find a time to meet). These people come again for other meetings. If they have organized enough meetings, we run a campaign to prompt you to consider the premium product, or we suggest that it'd be a good idea to have all these additional features. And you’ll use one of the teasers we have in the product and go through the purchasing flow. Not a very sales-heavy process. Only for big companies with a lot of users using the product do sales get involved,”

                                        Doodle saw that the value lay in adding more users to an account i.e. offering paid plans based on the number of users/members in a team. And at prospects who are at scale, it’s highly likely that they’ll have different team sizes willing to use the product.
                                    </p>

                                        Doodle wanted to capitalize on that and offer their product across multiple currencies with individual prices and different tiers. Today, they offer Tiered Pricing — instead of offering a single option of pricing and bucketing them into a “Buy” or “No Buy” situation. As a result Doodle’s prospects are able to select the plan that resonates with them the most, and aligns with what they value the most.

                                        Doodle’s free plan supports ads. Along with this, Doodle also offers two ad-free, paid plans using Chargebee’s tiered pricing - a ‘Private’ plan at €43 per year for a single user, and a ‘Business’ plan at a base price of €59 per year depending on the number of premium users signing up for the product. Typically, this works for businesses with professional teams of different sizes.

                                        As a B2C product, Freedom scaled fast. But their simple integration with Stripe did not support the scale in a way that they’d have liked. Rather, it was being an impediment to their growth.

                                        For Doodle, the freemium model worked. One of the reasons that made it work for them was the <strong>value metric</strong> they anchored their pricing on i.e. number of users in a team. Had this metric been anything else, it’d have been a disaster, like bringing in the wrong set of users. 
                                    </p>

                                        This happened with Chargebee's freemium based on the number of invoices before our (now) Launch Plan — when we offered 10 invoices for free and on the 11th invoice, the user upgrades to a paid plan. This ended up bringing in consultancies and agencies that did not have a huge customer portfolio.

                                        But freemium isn’t every business’s cup of tea. For most B2B businesses, freemium users take about 5 - 6 months to convert into paying customers on an average. Yes, it helps you acquire more customers. But if you’re someone who says, “I got my users, but they aren’t really paying…”, it’s probably time to revisit the strategy.

What kind of communications or nudges do you plan to push during trial? How will your product demonstrate its value? How long will it take for a customer to realize it? And how will you shape your freemium strategy around this in such a way that the moment the customer understands the value, your product nudges them to move up to a paid plan?

                                        Here’s the thing about discount campaigns — there’s more than one use of your coupons. Your discounts will be used to reheat cold prospects. You will use them to nudge a trial user into a paying customer. You will also run targeted discount campaigns to those who dropped off on your checkout page. And then there are the festivals and seasons where discounts are always welcomed by customers.

                                        Here’s another thing about discount campaigns — it will become incredibly messy if you were to run your coupon campaigns using a coupon management system. Or any other system that has a rudimentary coupon management functionality. For every customer acquired through a coupon, a corresponding subscription needs to be created, with the coupon details generated in their invoice. The coupon you issued needs to be trackable, and this information being reflected in the reports.

                                        Coupons and promotions boost conversions by providing the kind of incentive your users need to sign up. And your billing system helps close the loop on them, allowing you to segment the customers you want to send the coupon to, track how many people use it, change the subscriptions of people who do, alter the charge on the invoice, and factor the change into reports.

                                        BitGym is a US-based cardio app for Android, iOS, and Kindle, which loads up a video of different beautiful locations worldwide. From a Kickstarter campaign to one-time in-app purchases, to a Netflix-inspired subscription business model, BitGym has seen it all.

                                        Being a lean team of less than 10 members, BitGym started looking at expanding their marketing options, well, without a grand marketing team. They wanted to funnel people into the app directly from their website, but more meaningfully. Here’s an example: for a fitness app, they observed that they would see a spike in their subscriptions during the bloom season.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="cg-article__desc">
                                        In order to capitalize on this seasonal behaviour and expand their acquisition channels, BitGym would roll out special discounts and trackable coupons, with a one-time payment link. This incentivized more users to sign up to BitGym.

                                        This, along with offering additional payment options including Credit Card (via Stripe), Amazon payments, and PayPal, increased their monthly paying customers by 2x at that time.

                                        Think of the last time you booked your flight tickets, and you received the order confirmation. How many times did you open this email? Now remember the last time you opened a newsletter email that you don’t remember signing up to. Chances are that the former email required you to engage with it far more than the latter.

                                        Transactional emails have 8x more opens and clicks than any other type of email, and can generate 6x more revenue. As someone who holds the keys to data from every checkout and every sale, it’ll be worthwhile to use this information to initiate potential conversations with prospects — the worst that could happen is, they are reminded of your product with a minimum amount of engagement. And the best that could happen is they become customers.

                                        Transactional emails such as an on boarding email present an opportunity to get customers move from a trial to a paid plan — you could start conversations, personalize your product recommendations, or even offer discounts. They also help in recovering potentially lost revenue, should a transaction fail.

                                        Well, of course you could use an email marketing platform to run these campaigns. But here’s the challenge. What you would lack with the emails from your marketing platform is context.

                                        For instance, you’d like to automate a timed-discount campaign plus a trial extension email campaign to a segment of subscribers whose trial period is close to expiry. Your billing system will present this context far quicker and easier for you to run your campaign. Or, you want to email subscribers whose cards have expired, requesting them to update their card details to avoid involuntary churn.
                                    </p>

                                        Your billing system will be able to provide that context — it allows you to segment and automate transactional emails, and any subsequent outcome will be tied back to the subscription status and reports. Here’s an outline on how you could leverage transactional emails to improve acquisitions and conversions.

                                        Whiteboard is a US-based mortgage-CRM that helps Loan Officers and their teams systematize the mortgage process and cultivate relationships with their partners in the real estate space.

                                        For Whiteboard, the biggest challenge while using PayPal and then Braintree for automating their recurring billing was lack of a solid automation to recover revenue from payment failures and send email communications for follow-ups.

                                        Building a self-serve SaaS product translates to more power in the hands of your customer. Of course, it doesn’t mean that there is no human touch when your customer uses your product. But, for a self-serve business to be able to operate at scale, it’s important to be able to build as many automations as possible. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="cg-article__desc">
                                        Automations are powerful, because they let you invest in ways to be more human with your product. Strange, right? 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="cg-article__desc">
                                        For instance, if you have a customer who has signed up with your product, and you have built an integration with Slack, that notifies you of this, you immediately drop a “welcome onboard” note to your customer, and send additional onboarding materials and training videos, on the go. 
                                    </p>

                                        Or here’s another instance. Say you have a prospect who’s on trial which is coming to an end in two days. An integration with Intercom will let you push for better activations with a more contextual question and support such as “Hey, I see your trial is ended. Were you able to play around with our reports? Here’s a tip on how you can reduce your churn…” can go a long way. 
                                    </p>

                                        Or here’s one more instance. You are a B2C SaaS with high volume and low ARPU. A solid integration with Xero helps you reconcile thousands of payments in a single go, without you having to shuttle between multiple CSVs and imports and exports. And your finance team can focus on drawing the bigger picture, perhaps identifying a better acquisition channel with low investment and high RoI.

                                        All of these automations paired with the ability to detect opportunities serve as a good fodder to find potential high value customers who are more likely to benefit from a more personal touch.

                                        <strong>How Proxyclick uses Intercom to nudge Trial users in Chargebee into activation…</strong> 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="cg-article__desc">
                                        Proxyclick, a Brussels-based visitor management solution, started scaling globally with a mix of SMBs and Enterprises among its audience. Pricing was never an issue — they would offer a fixed pricing on the face of it, but also allowed room for negotiation with dynamic pricing. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="cg-article__desc">
                                        Proxyclick put in a lot of effort to onboard their customers into the product. Introducing a human element wherever possible was one of their key requirements. With a limited 15-days trial period, they wanted to identify every avenue where they could guide their users on to the next stage of the acquisition funnel. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="cg-article__desc">
                                        Proxyclick’s marketing would track the journey of their trial users in the product. They designed outreach and onboarding campaigns around this journey, moving their prospects into the nurturing bucket. 
                                    </p>

                                        How did they do it? Chargebee’s integration with Intercom using webhooks gave them visibility into their prospects’ trial status, and once they were close to ending their free trial, they’d push relevant and contextual messaging, offering guides and tips, that led to better conversion.
