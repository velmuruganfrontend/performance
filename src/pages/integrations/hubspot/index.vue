                                                Help your sales team focus on closing deals instead of switching tabs. With subscription data firmly in HubSpot, teams now have visibility of where each subscription is on the deal pipeline, so they can follow up effectively. The best part? Sales reps can create subscriptions right from within HubSpot with the click of a button, instead of dipping their fingers into the billing system.

                                                When a deal has to be closed, make it easy for your prospects and customers to make payments—facilitate your sales team to send subscription checkout links out of HubSpot deals. Customers can not only preview the subscription details but also enter payment information and complete the purchase by themselves.
