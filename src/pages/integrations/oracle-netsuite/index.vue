Trigger sales order creation in NetSuite automatically, when a subscription (or an invoice) is created in Chargebee, so your team can approve the sales order or take it up for fulfilment. Chargebee can also initiate payment collection for you when your invoices are generated. All your generated invoices are synced by Chargebee against your sales orders in NetSuite. When you receive payments via Chargebee, they are further synced against these invoices in NetSuite. And what if your payment is collected before the invoices are synced? No problem, these payments will be recorded in NetSuite as Customer Deposits.</p>
