This experience has been applied to the AWS platform and infrastructure. AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities, with military grade perimeter control berms. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, state of the art intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication no fewer than three times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in. They are also continually escorted by authorized staff.”
