                                Consent and transparency have long inherited the margins of organizations' pursuit of customer information. And the <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank">EU's General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) was a much-needed push to bring them to the center.

                                With the regulations that came into action in May 2018, it handed EU customers the power to control their personal information that businesses store and handle, without tradeoffs.

                            <p class="cb-factor__desc">In whatever we do, we ensure that we go the extra mile to make our customers' lives easier. And our GDPR compliance efforts are no exception.</p>


                            <p class="cb-factor__desc">
                            In addition to making Chargebee GDPR compliant, we wanted to help our customers (or merchants) leverage Chargebee to become GDPR compliant as well, without having to break a sweat. 
                            </p>

                            <p class="cb-factor__desc">Here are some actions we undertook to do just that:</p>

                            <ul class="cb-factor__list">
                                <li class="cb-factor__item">Connecting both the merchant and the end-user, we allow merchants to collect, record, and withdraw <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/docs/consent-management.html">consent</a>, directly from the checkout pages and customer portal. </li>

                                <li class="cb-factor__item">We have charted out a plan that will help merchants handle their customers’ <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/docs/personal-data-management.html">PII data</a> when a customer cancels their subscription with the merchant. This allows merchants to clear PII data while still ensuring that numbers are not affected in the aggregate reporting of data. This is available in the app and as an API.</li>

                                <li  class="cb-factor__item">Our <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/docs/customer_portal.html">self-serve portal</a> is now fully configurable— it enables merchants to give their end-users the option to view, update, edit or clear any personal information they have shared with them.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="cb-factor__desc">While this is only the first step towards our commitment to help you handle the requirements of data privacy and protection, we are continuing to explore other features in the context of GDPR and data security. We encourage you to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@chargebee.com">support@chargebee.com</a> if you have any feature requests, and we are happy to discuss its feasibility.</p>
