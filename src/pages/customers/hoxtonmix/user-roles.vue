                                                The Hoxton Mix began as one such creative hub in Shoreditch, the artsy town of East London, in 2007. Soon, it evolved into a suite of different solutions, that would help businesses anywhere to have a presence in London, without actually being in London.

    Their Virtual Office solution provides startups with an address, a mail-forwarding service complete with a virtual receptionist.

The Hoxton Mix gives companies not just a place to work from, but an infrastructure to help businesses to grow."

                                            To manage their subscriptions for the Co-work & Virtual Office solution, they started off with a simple solution that they built on top of their payment gateway.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="cn-mar--b-st">
                                            However, with the tech boom and more startups popping up in Central London, they discovered that The Hoxton Mix grew more popular, which was a good area to be located.
                                            </p>

                                            When there were small fixes like a subscription upgrade, downgrade or refunds, we had to always involve engineers. This was a problem which obviously incurred a cost. And that's when we realised the need for a solution like Chargebee which would give the <strong>Support & the Sales teams</strong> the flexibility to handle things without involving much of development time.
