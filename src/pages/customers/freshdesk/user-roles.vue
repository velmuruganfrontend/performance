                                                In early 2012, when Freshdesk was nearing 500 customers, there were too many things to deal with and too few people to tend to them.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="cn-mar--b-st">
                                                Freshdesk was built around creating great customer experiences and they understood that billing was an essential part of this. They had a team of two developers focused full-time on handling DevOps and billing related issues.

                                                They had built a billing engine on Rails, on top of Braintree subscriptions, to handle most things on their own. But the rate at which they were growing, was too fast for their billing engine. 
                                            </p>

                                                The sales team wanted to issue discounts and extend trials.

                                            <li>
                                                The finance team needed a way to accept and manage different payment methods.

                                                The internal team of two went all in. They dealt with the queries themselves for some time, and then created an admin billing interface, with different teams in mind.

                                                But tensions still remained. They had to tinker with the billing engine every other day which began to slow things down across the company.

Developers ended up working on billing cases, rather than the product. The support and sales teams depended on engineering to carry out small tasks related to billing.
