                                                When VMP started out, the demand grew steadily by word-of-mouth. VMP went cash flow positive right from the first month of launch and continued to grow their subscriber base each month.

                                                The next big step was to migrate their existing subscriptions to Chargebee. Since VMP was a physical business, they relied on their subscriber data to ship out records each month. This meant the migration process shouldn't affect the existing vinyl lovers, nor deter any new subscribers from signing up.

Now, VMP offers a lot more to their subscribers, with Chargebee powering their paywall kind of system.

                                                            VMP, like any good lean business, doesn’t like to employ people where technology can do the job. Managing ‘customer preferences’ is one such area. VMP’s customers are each given a login and a portal where they can update their preferences real time, all by themselves. That’s plenty of man hours saved for VMP and very convenient for their customers.
