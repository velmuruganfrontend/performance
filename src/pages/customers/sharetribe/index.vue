                                            Sharetribe is a SaaS company that lets entrepreneurs start an online marketplace, easily. What began as a university project for founders Antti and Juho, became a marketplace business. Soon, other entrepreneurs began approaching them for their marketplace platform. Realising the need for a marketplace platform, they pivoted into a what is today Sharetribe.

                                                Sharetribe invoiced their first few local customers through their accounting office, manually. Their first international customers were invoiced via PayPal but this process was still manual.But they realised this solution could not scale. Not to mention their hatred for manual work. Also, as a growing SaaS company, it was important to keep track of payments and their metrics.

                                                But since their data was split across spreadsheets, payment tools and accounting system, it was <strong>difficult for them to crunch these numbers.</strong>

                                                Another problem they often ran into was reminding their clients to pay. Chasing payments manually was a pain.
