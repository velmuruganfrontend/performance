                               <h4>Why should I use Chargebee instead of building my own billing system?</h4>
                               <div>
                                   <p>Recurring billing is much more than billing at periodic intervals. To ensure your customers have a great shopping experience, you need to provide them with a simple and easy to use payment system. We offer you just that.</p>
                                   <p>We also help reduce customer churn by giving you actionable data with the help of notifications and reports to ensure that you are on top of things with your business. </p>
                                   <p>Building a billing system on your own requires a lot of time, effort and focus from management. Using us, you can least of all be at peace knowing that your entire customer billing is handled by the experts in the most secure way.</p>

                                   <p>You can sign up online to explore our application sandbox right away. To get paid online from users, you will need a payment gateway &amp; merchant account from any of the supported payment gateways. It takes anywhere between a few days to a few weeks to get an approved payment gateway account, so please factor that in to go-live.</p>

                                   <p>All the subscriptions of that plan will continue to remain, unless we explicitly move them to another plan. The deletion is only a "soft" delete that stops the plan from allowing new subscriptions.</p>

We have taken several measures to ensure continued service across regions. Unless there is an outage across a large region &amp; multiple data centers, the service will be accessible for users.</p>

                                   <p>As a merchant you are still responsible for chargebacks as the merchant account is owned by you.

                                   <p>Yes you may at any time. It is called the "DBA name" ("Doing-Business-As"). Please contact your merchant account provider / payment gateway to update the correct name.</p>
                                   <p>One of the best practices is to ensure you use your DBA name as the most recognized name by customers - example your company may be called "ACME Inc.," but if customers are familiar with the name "campbase.com", use the latter as your DBA name.</p>
                                   <p>And you can append also the DBA name with a phone number or other contact information, so customers can readily reach out in case of questions.</p>

                               <div>
                                   <p>A payment gateway is a software service that authorizes payments for eCommerce transactions.</p>
                                   <p>Imagine this to be the pipe that connects the end user credit cards that are issued by thousands of banks across the world (WellsFargo, Bank of America etc.,) with the card networks (Visa, Master, Amex, Discover etc.,) and eventually your bank account. Of course, there is lot that goes into what a payment gateway does including verifications, authorizations, fraud detection, currency exchange, settlements etc., but essentially it is a software component on the internet to help route money.</p>
                               </div>

                               <div>
                                   <p>A merchant account is a type of bank account that allows businesses to accept payments by debit or credit cards or bank transfers. It is a line of credit extended to businesses by the bank, after due risk assessment.</p>
                                   <p>End users can apply a chargeback and retrieve the money back, if the business fails to deliver the promised service. And the line of credit extended by bank is used to reimburse such chargebacks and recover it from business. This is why there is a risk assessment of business and certain restrictions are applied on a merchant account, unlike a standard bank account.</p>
                               </div>

                               <div>
                                   <p>Yes, you can. In fact you will need a merchant account & payment gateway (in some cases there is no separation like the case of PayPal Payments Pro) to be configured in Chargebee, to process payments on your behalf.</p>
                               </div>

                                   <p>No. With many of the gateways, you have the option to store credit card in the payment gateway vault, usually for an additional charge. When you use Chargebee services, this is not required as it is included in the charges for Chargebee.</p>
                               </div>

                                   <p>No. You do not need the recurring billing module separately from your payment gateway. For example, Authorize.net offers an ARB (Automated Recurring Billing) that helps solve specific use cases for merchants who need recurring billing. However, when you use Chargebee solution, you do not need this. Just a standard account is enough.</p>
                               </div>

                                   <p>Yes. You can even drive customers to be subscribed via different gateways, by just configuring the gateways. You would set one by default and then can control change of gateway for specific subscriptions.</p>
